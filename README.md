* When logged in, the root URL should show the messages from all the people you follow.
* People can post "messages," "cheeps," or whatever you want to call them. They're tweets, but please don't call them that.
* Getting the list of messages for You + people you follow is tricky'ish. Think of it like this:

```ruby
class User
  def timeline
    follower_ids = following_users.pluck(:id)
    all_ids = follower_ids << user.id
    Post.where(user_id: all_ids).order("created_at DESC")
  end
end
```
